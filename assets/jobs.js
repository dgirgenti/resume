Zoomi is an artificial intelligence platform for learning which provides first-of-its-kind prescriptive analytics to instructors. I was a full-stack developer responsible for various projects.

While in Zoomi's fast-paced environment I implemented and maintained a number of production features on multiple products. Most notably, I architected and built Zoomi's asset management and content ingestion systems, which were responsible for processing and adapting an increasing list of supported media types and learning standards into the production client application.

Common tasks included: Building new features on the API and client application; Maintaining asset management processes and systems; Documenting and discussing technical specifications and requirements with clients and researchers.`,

Club OS is a health club CRM and Web platform. I was one of two front-end engineers, and together we worked alongside the designer and back-end team to develop new features for the platform.

My largest project involvement was an extensible, responsive UI kit based on Bootstrap. The kit served as the authoritative source of UI component styling for all future internal and external Web apps, as well as the re-skinning of the existing app. It contained various styles, themes, Javascript components, a custom SVG icon font, and a jQuery datepicker plugin I named "datejawn".

Common tasks included: Refactoring, cleaning, and maintaining front-end codebase; Automating commonly-performed tasks; Creating and modifying custom (non-)embedded forms as requested by external stakeholders; Participating in team planning and discussions related to front-end architecture and workflow.`,
