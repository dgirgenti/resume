Urban Outfitters is a multinational clothing & lifestyle retailer. The Web team is responsible for the front-end ecommerce platforms of **[Urban Outfitters](https://urbanoutfitters.com)**, **[Anthropologie](https://anthropologie.com)**, and **[Free People](https://freepeople.com/)**. I am currently a Senior Software Engineer.

I have most recently held a platform architecture role during a front-end replatform to a progressive web application using Server-side Vue. The performance-first app relies heavily on async route- and component-level chunking, dynamic module registration, lazy loading, and lazy hydration. The project involves adhering to strict performance budgets and meeting WCAG AA compliance.

* Develop or migrate UI features, components, and whole routes to the Vue PWA
* Advise in architecture and styling matters across the Web teams
* Serve as codeowner on all core files for peer review and guidance
* Ensure constant optimization of app performance
  * Deprioritization of background and below-the-fold functionality
  * Decreasing bytes over the wire by decreasing bundle sizes and limiting extraneous data
  * Compare performance over time using automated Lighthouse scripts
  * Implement A/B or multivariate tests for partial rollouts, feature comparison, and conversion testing
* Present information during weekly knowledge-sharing sessions
* Gather and document requirements by interfacing with product owners, business analysts, back-end engineers, analytics & SEO managers, etc.

In addition to this role, I served as style lead from January to April 2019, interfacing with designers & UX to oversee the design system, mixin/component libraries, and style guides.

Prior to October 2018, I developed features on a Python/Tornado app with a custom JS component library and Redux.`,
